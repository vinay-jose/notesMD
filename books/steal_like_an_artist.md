### The Good Stuff

+ "All advice is autobiographical"
+ Copy great work, fall short, adapt and create your own version
+ "Garbage in, garbage out."
+ Do the work you want to see get done, 
    build the product you want to use, 
    create the music you want to listen to
+ Just doing things you know how to ends up boring
+ Use your hands, move your body
+ Side projects / hobbies are important, protect and nurture them
+ "Don't throw any parts of yourself away"
+ "Don't worry about unity [of your work] from piece to piece - what unifies all of your work is the fact that you made it"
+ "You can't connect the dots looking forward, 
    you can only connect them looking backwards" - Steve Jobs
+ Do good work (the hard part), 
    share it with people (relatively easy - post about it online)
+ Forget about validation, write public fan letters
+ Do boring stuff, find time to get bored.
+ "Inertia is the death of creativity"
+ Build systems; track habits
+ Creativity is Subtraction - do less, say less
+ Constraints bring out the best work in you
    - eg: Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss - written using only 50 words 
+ Creativity isn't just what you put in, it's also what you leave out.

### My Thoughts

One thing that stayed with me most is the advice to find time for your passion and protective of the piece. 
Lot of these ideas are also discussed in books of Cal Newport. 
The Steve Job quote reminds of something Eric Ries said about pieces of work culminating in a magnum opus. 
Austin Kleon keeps the books short and to the point. It was a good listen, and I am looking forward to the next one in the trilogy!
